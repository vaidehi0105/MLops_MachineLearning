# MLops_MachineLearning
Implementing Simplified MLops for a Machine Learning Project

## Step 1: Version Control

### 1. Create a new public GitHub repository for your MLops assignment.
### 2. Initialize the repository with a README file
### 3. Write a simple Python script to train a machine learning model on a dataset of your choice.
### Here I have used dataset for predicting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in Women by comparing different machine learning models.

### 4. Commit your code to the repository and push it to GitHub.
