# MLops_MachineLearning
Implementing Simplified MLops for a Machine Learning Project

## Step 1: Version Control

 1. Create a new public GitHub repository for your MLops assignment.
 2. Initialize the repository with a README file
 3. Write a simple Python script to train a machine learning model on a dataset of your choice. Here I have used dataset from sklearn datasets which is diabetes datasets. Columns in this dataset are Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age and Diabetes(0 or 1)
 4. Commit your code to the repository and push it to GitHub.

## Step 2: 

#### Software and tools required:
